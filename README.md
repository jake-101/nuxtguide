# nuxtguide

This site is a personal collection of my favorite resources for Nuxt.js. I use Vue & Nuxt when developing websites and save a lot of links to cool libraries and tutorials.

The code for the site is open source and available on Github. This site wouldn't exist without the hard work of all of the people who maintain open source projects like Vue.js.

- Nuxt Guide is built using Nuxt.js
- Prismic.io as its CMS
- TailwindCSS is used for layout & design, wysiwyg.css is used for HTML content areas.
- The site is hosted on Zeit Now.
- The Inter type family is used and the regular width typeface is subset for faster loading.
